<details id="whatIsPython">
  <summary>What is Python?</summary>
  <p>Python is a versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.</p>
</details>
<details id="historyOfPython"><summary>HISTORY OF PYTHON</summary>
<div><p>
Guido van Rossum created Python in the late 1980s as an alternative to traditional programming languages. The first version was released in 1991. He is decorated by the title "The Great Dictator of Life" for his dominance in programming and his supreme authority over Python and depended languages. <br>
Python program structure is similar to the data analysing and control methods used by Guglielmo Markoni in his invention of radio transmitters. Hence it is considered as the predecessor of python syntax. 
</p> </div>
</details>
<details id="featuresOfPython">
<summary>FEATURES OF PYTHON</summary>
<div>
<li>Easy to Learn: <br> Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to learn, making it a great language for beginners. </li>
<li>High-Level Language: <br> Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their program. </li>
<li>Object-Oriented: <br> Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism. </li>
<li>Dynamic Typing: <br> Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable before using it. </li>
<li>Large Standard Library: <br> Python has an extensive collection of libraries and modules that make it suitable for various tasks, such as data analysis, web development, and more. </li>
<li>Cross-Platform: <br> Python can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. </li>
<li>Extensive Community: <br> Python has a vast and active community, ensuring there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting. </li>
<li>Rapid Development: <br> Python's syntax and nature make it ideal for rapid prototyping and development. </li>
<li>Integration: <br> Python can easily integrate with other languages and tools, making it a popular choice for scripting and automation. </li>
</div>

<details id="instalingPython">
<summary>INSTALLING PYTHON... </summary>
<div>
<li>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</li>
<li>You can install python directly from python.org site. Installing via this method will automatically install an IDLE platform in your system where you can run your python code effortlessly.</li>
<li>Online Compilers <br> You can access program in python using several online platform (python compilers). Most of them are free and facilitates google account sign in to save your code. <br> In today's interactive workshop, we are using such an online platform called Replit, where you can try running the coding techniques you will learn here, whenever you like. For convienience. </li>
<li> Android/ios applications <br> 
Few notable apps i can suggest are pydroid, pymata, pyrun, etc..</li>
<li> VSCode <br>
It is the most widely used software for pythom programming.</li>
<li>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe): <br>
<span>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version </span><br> </li>
<li>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type: <br>
<span>python --version </span><br> </li>
<li>Once python is installed, you can even run a responsive python IDLE in terminal by entering the following in the terminal: <br>
<span>python3</span> <br> </li>

<br> <h2>Python Basics</h2>
<details id="variables">
<summary>Variables, values and constants</summary>
<p> Variables are certain memory locations allotted in the program to save data which are supposed to change over time. values are the data saved into the variables. in certain and situations, the values in the variables are not supposed to change during code execution. this value is called as constants. unlike most other languages, python doesn't have a way to declare a constant. so certain naming conventions are practiced to denote constant values.
<br> <li> Using CAPSNAME </li>
<br> <li> Using cc_name </li>
<br> <li> Uaing camelCase</li>
<br> When naming a variable or constant, only include upper and lowercase alphabets, numbers and under scores. no spaces or fullstops. name shouldn't start with a number or underscore. in case of names having spaces, use underscore instead or follow camelCase standard. 
</p>
<li><span>variable_name="Name"</span></li>
<li><span>variable_number="30"</span></li>
<li><span>cc_gravitational_constant=9.814</span></li>
<li><span>variableName="Name"</span></li>

</details>
<details id="controlStructures">
  <summary>Control Structures</summary>
  <p>They are keywords which are used to run a certain codeblock as long as a specific condition is satisfied.</p>
  <li>if... elif...else</li>
  <p>Checks whether the condition is satisfied before running the code. <span>if ...</span> states the initial condition, <span>elif... elif... elif...</span> can be used to define alrenate conditions, if the primary condition is not satisfied, <span>else...</span> definea the action to be taken if none of the conditions are satisfied.</p>
  <span> CODEBLOCK
    today = "friday" <br> 
    if today == "sunday" : <br>
    <span>__</span> print("Today is a holiday") <br>
    elif today == "saturday" : <br>
    <span>__</span> print("Today is a weekend") <br>
    else : <br>
    <span>__</span>
  </span>
  <li>for loop</li>
  <p> Checks whether the condition is satisfied before executing the code and loops through it as long as the condition remain satisfied. <span>break</span> and <span>continue</span> are some of the methods used in for loop to terminate and skip the repeating code, even while the condition for the codeblock is satisfied.</p>
  <span> for i in range(5) :<br>
  <span>__</span>print(i)</span>
  <p> here, the variable which pass through incrementation each time the loop repeats, is known as iterator, which controls the condition for the code execution.</p>
  <li>while loop</li>
  <p> While loop is similar to for loop in most cases, but the major difference between them is, in for loop the iteration number is known or predictable and the number of times the code is repeated is predefined before executing the code. But in while loop, the number of times the code repeats is unknown and the code repeats as long as the condition is proved to be unsatisfiable.</p>
  <span>i=0<br>
  while i<0 : <br>
    <span>__</span> print(i) <br>
    i= i+1
  </span>
</details>
<details id="controlFlow">
  <summary>Control Flow or Console Flow</summary>
  <li><span>print() </span> outputs a value to the console, which can be a string, integer, data stored in a variable, a list, a dataset, etc,.</li>
  <span>print("Welcome to CodeForge")</span> <br>
  <span>print("32+18")</span> <br>
  <span>a =32/4<br>
  print(a)</span>
  <li><span>input("prompt")</span> takes in a user input from keyboard and can be stored in a variable or constant</li>
  <span>a=input("Enter your name") <br>
  print("Hello \t",a,"\n","Welcome to CodeForge"</span>
</details>
<details id="dataTypes">
  <summary>Data Types</summary>
  <p>Data types defines in which format the data we store into a variable is saved. Unlike other programming languages, in python, the interpreter and compiler can self distinguish the type of data we store into a variable, to an extent. we can also convert one data type into other in most cases, while it may sometimes alters the data itself. Different datatypes occupy different amount of storage space in bytes.</p>
  <li>str() - String file - "Hello World!" </li>
  <li>int() - integer - 1,2,3,....</li>
  <li>float() - decimal values - 1.1, 2.6, 7.9,....</li>
  <li>boolean() - state - True or False</li>
  <li>list() - a collection of similar or different datatypes - ["hello", 2, 3.7, True]</li>
</details>
<details id="functions">
  <summary>Functions</summary>
  <p> They are a set of predefined code, saved in a location, which does not execute on its own unless it is called upon in the main program. </p>
  <span> def myFunction (): <br>
  __ a=6 <br>
  __ b=7 <br>
  __ print(a*b)<br>
  <br>
  myFunction() </span>
</details>
<details id="libraries">
  <summary>Libraries</summary>
  <p>A Python library is a collection of related modules. It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs.<br> 
    In python, libraries are usually added to our main program by <span>import</span> keyword.</p>
    <br> <br>
    <p>Lets try out a fun library this time. Open your Replit section and try out this code.</p>
    <span>from turtle import * <br>
    for i in range (4): <br>
    __ fd(20)
    __ lt(90)</span>
</details>
<details id="syntax">
  <summary>Syntax</summary>
  <p>Python syntax is the set of rules that determine the structure and arrangement of code, including keywords, operators, indentation, and punctuation</p>
  <li>Intendation - number of spaces in each code line of a parent code block</li>
  <li>Keywords - Reserved words for the functioning of python language</li>
  <li>Operators - certain symbols used to interact with memory allocation of code, by system.</li>
  <li>Punctuation - proper usage of double colon when defining control structures, usage of spaces and tabspaces in code blocks, using # and triple quotes to include comments and documentation in your code and functions</li>
</details>

<br> <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
<details id="functionsAndMethods">
  <summary>Functions & Methods</summary>
  <li> Functions are set of predefined program, independent of normal code flow, and does not execute on its own unless called by the main program. <br> It utalises global and local scopes to define the data used and stored within and it can except data as well as return data from and to between the function code block and main code. </li>
  <li> Methods are set of instructions contained within a function, which can utalise the data and code within the function, in various independent purposes. It poses a part of the general function , which is exclusive to execute a specific function. </li>
</details>
<details id="objectOrientedProgramming">
  <summary>Object Oriented Programming</summary>
  <p> OOP is an approach of generalizing a model that organizes the raw code, variables and related functions in a code, to the concept of objects, which can interact with each other. <br> 
     It focuses on manupulating the objects rather than the logic that controls it. It is a complex approach and is suitable for large scale, complex programming like app development and machine learning.</p>
</details>
<details id="classObjectInheritance">
<summary>Class Objects & Inheritance</summary>
<p>Class - Categorizes datas and functions into groups which share similar logic, properties, and method of implementation.</p>
<li>Distinctive Classes - different  properties, different  methods</li>
<li>Dependant Classes - different  properties, same methods</li>
<li>Distortive Classes - same properties, different methods</li>
<li>Degenerative Classes - same properties, same methods, different purpose</li>
</details>

<br> <h2>Error Handling</h2>
<details id="evaluation">
  <summary>Evaluation</summary>
  <li>Eval() method is an underrated method in the modern application of python programming!! </li>
  <li> Purpose of eval()</li>
  <li> Why eval() is no longer used ? </li>
</details>
<details id="execution">
  <summary>Execution</summary>
  <li> try: handler attempts to execute a code which may or may not be faulty, and helps to maintain program flow without termination even if errors are present</li>
  <li> try: handler has a code block which its attempts to execute, if it has errors, the code is exempted and passed to exception handler.</li>
</details>
<details id="exception">
  <summary>Exception</summary>
  <li> except: handler catches the errors from try: block and returns a response, without terminating the programs flow. </li>
  <li> except: block will handles almost all types of code errors like SyntaxError, NameError, etc</li>
  <span> try: <br>
  __ for x in range (8): <br>
  __ __ print(y) <br>

  <p>Indexing refers to the process of accessing a specific element in a sequence, such as a string or list, using its position or index number. Indexing in Python starts at 0, which means that the first element in a sequence has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.</p>
